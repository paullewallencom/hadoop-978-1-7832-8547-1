Building
========
This code uses Gradle to automate the compiling and building of the projects. 

* You can install Gradle by following the guide provided in http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/installation.html.  Usually you only have to download and extract the Gradle distribution from http://www.gradle.org/downloads  and add the bin directory of the extracted Gradle distribution to to your path variable.
* All the sample codes can be built by issuing the "gradle build" command in the main folder of the code repository.
* Project files for Eclipse IDE can be generated by running the run "gradle eclipse" command in the main folder of the code repository. Project files for IntelliJ IDEA IDE can be generated by running the run "gradle idea" command in the main folder of the code repository. 
* After a succesfull build, you can find the Jar files for each of the chapters inside the "build/libs" folder of each chapter.
